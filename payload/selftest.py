"""Mint a known-good dependency lock and resolve the SD-1.5 mirror, before spending GPU hours.

This job exists to retire one specific failure permanently. On 2026-09-15 the training run
died at import with ``ImportError: cannot import name 'FLAX_WEIGHTS_NAME'`` because the
notebook installed "the latest mutually-consistent stack" and hoped. Hope is not a pinning
strategy.

The lock produced here is a *recorded observation of a session that actually worked*:
install candidates, ``pip check``, import everything, resolve the model, run five real
training steps, then freeze. Every later job asserts the lock's sha256 and re-runs the
import smoke test, so a broken environment costs 30 seconds instead of a 20-minute
head-fake.

Rule zero: never reinstall ``torch``. Use whatever the Colab image ships. Touching torch is
the most reliable way to break a working Colab environment, and it costs several minutes.
