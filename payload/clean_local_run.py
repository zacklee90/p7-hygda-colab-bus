"""Wipe one run's LOCAL output directory, to make a session death reproducible on demand.

Killing a Colab *cell* leaves ``/content`` intact, so a retry resumes from local disk and
never exercises the Drive restore path. Killing a *session* wipes ``/content`` entirely -
and that is the case that actually matters, because a 6000-step run on a T4 takes about
12 hours and cannot finish inside one session.

Running this between a cancelled attempt and its retry turns "we hope resume-from-Drive
works" into "we watched resume-from-Drive work". It is a separate, logged job rather than
a hidden flag inside the training payload so the deletion is visible in the record.

Only ever touches ``/content`` scratch under this run's own directory; Drive is untouched,
which is the entire point - the Drive checkpoints are what the retry must find.
